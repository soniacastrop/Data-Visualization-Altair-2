# Data-Visualization-Altair-2
In this project the information of 10 departments of UPC is extracted and visualizations are implemented to solve the following tasks:

- **1.** Interactive graph on the number of articles published by year and department. The departments (1 to all) can be selected through the legend,the selected ones are highlighted by color. 
The mean is always shown no matter the selection with a different tiype of line. Finally, the largest growth intervals of each department are highlighted by the line thickness.
- **2.** Interactive map of the Barcelona neighborhoods where the UPC campus is located. Departments are color coded and selectable on the map. When we hover over a department we see information 
about it. If we have a selected department, the information about it is kept until we hover over another one.
- **3.** Plot that is coordinated with the previous map. It shows department stats for the selected department.
- **4.** Interactive scatter plot that relates the size of the department with the number of published articles. The regression line is shown to show explicitly the relationship between the variables. 
In addition to a tooltip and to coordinate it with the map so that the department can be selected from any of the two plots.
- **5.** Coordinated plot with the previous 3 that shows the number of personnel according to their gender in each of the positions of the selected department

Every step considered is further explained in the jupyter notebook.
